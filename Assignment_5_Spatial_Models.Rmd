1) Examine if there is evidence of spatial dependence in a rare and a common species in the BCI tree dataset.

```{r}
sp_total = apply(BCI, 2, sum)
sp_total
mean(sp_total)
hist(colSums(BCI))
hist(log10(colSums(BCI)))
```

A common species can be defines as having an abundance greater than 1000
A rare species can be defined as having an abundance less than 100

Common Species :: "Trichilia.tuberculata" - 1681
Rare Species :: "Tachigali.versicolor" - 98


*Trichilia tuberculata* - Common Species

```{r}
#create a data subset for tuberculata
tuberculata = BCI[ , "Trichilia.tuberculata"]

#calculate tuberculata Euclidian distance
tuberculata_dist = dist(tuberculata)

#calculate spatial distance
xy_dist = dist(BCI_xy)

#define parameter for max distance
max_dist = max(xy_dist) / 2

#plot results
plot(xy_dist, tuberculata_dist, xlab = "Spatial Distance", ylab = "Euclidian Distance", main = "Trichilia tuberculata")
abline(lm(tuberculata_dist ~ xy_dist), lwd=3, col='red')
lines(lowess(xy_dist, tuberculata_dist), lwd=3, col='pink')
abline(v = max_dist, col='red', lwd=3, lty=2)
```

In the above graphic, both the theoretical and smoother line are relatively flat, indicating that the distribution of Trichilia tuberculata is not spatially structured but is instead random. 

```{r}
#compute observed correlation of tuberculata Euclidian distance to overall spatial distance
obs_tuberculata_cor = cor(xy_dist, tuberculata_dist)
obs_tuberculata_cor
```

Observed correlation = 0.02876206 (~2.9% correlation)

```{r}
#conduct permutation test for tuberculata significance
nperm = 1000
null_tuberculata_cor = obs_tuberculata_cor
for (i in 2:nperm) {
  tuber_tmp_xy = BCI_xy[sample(nrow(BCI_xy)), ]
  null_tuberculata_cor[i] = cor(dist(tuber_tmp_xy), tuberculata_dist)
}
#p-value
sum(null_tuberculata_cor >= obs_tuberculata_cor) / nperm 
```

p-value ~ 0.3, variance between tuberculata null correlation and observed correlation is not significant (observed correlation does not differ significantly from null correlation)

```{r}
#mantel() function test for tuberculata
tuberculata_mantel = mantel(xy_dist, tuberculata_dist)
tuberculata_mantel
```

The mantel() correlation test yields a p-value ~ 0.3 (rougly similar to the p-value from the permutations test) and a Mantel statistic of r = 0.02876

```{r}
#construct boxplot comparison of permutation test to mantel test
boxplot(list(null_tuberculata_cor, tuberculata_mantel$perm), horizontal = T, boxwex = 0.5,
        names = c('Permutation', 'Mantel'), xlab='Correlation', main = 'Trichilia tuberculata correlation')
abline(v=obs_tuberculata_cor, col='red')
```

The results of both tests look relatively similar. Both indicate that observed correlation is not significantly greater than null correlation. Instead, there appears to be no statistically significant difference between observed correlation and null correlation, indicating that the distribution of Trichilia tuberculata is not significantly correlated to spatial structure but is instead random. There does not appear to be evidence of spatial dependence for this species. 



*Tachigali versicolor* - Rare species


```{r}
#create data subset for Tachigali versicolor
versicolor = BCI[ , "Tachigali.versicolor"]

#calculate Euclidian distance
versicolor_dist = dist(versicolor)

#calculate spatial distance (same as previous)
xy_dist = dist(BCI_xy)

#redefine parameter for max distance
max_dist = max(xy_dist) / 2

#plot results
plot(xy_dist, versicolor_dist, xlab = "Spatial Distance", ylab = "Euclidian Distance", main = "Tachigali versicolor")
abline(lm(versicolor_dist ~ xy_dist), lwd=3, col='red')
lines(lowess(xy_dist, versicolor_dist), lwd=3, col='pink')
abline(v = max_dist, col='red', lwd=3, lty=2)
```

The above graph gives similar results as Trichilia tuberculata. Both the theoretical and smoother lines are relatively flat, indicating that versicolor distribution is not spatially dependent but appears to be random instead.  

```{r}
#compute observed correlation of versicolor Euclidian distance to overall spatial distance
obs_versicolor_cor = cor(xy_dist, versicolor_dist)
obs_versicolor_cor
```

Observed correlation = 0.01059894 (~1.1% correlation)

```{r}
#conduct permutation test for versicolor significance
nperm = 1000
null_versicolor_cor = obs_versicolor_cor
for (i in 2:nperm) {
  versi_tmp_xy = BCI_xy[sample(nrow(BCI_xy)), ]
  null_versicolor_cor[i] = cor(dist(versi_tmp_xy), versicolor_dist)
}
#p-value
sum(null_versicolor_cor >= obs_versicolor_cor) / nperm
```

p-value ~ 0.4, variance between null correlation and observed correlation is insignificant (observed correlation is not larger than null)

```{r}
#mantel() function test for versicolor
versicolor_mantel = mantel(xy_dist, versicolor_dist)
versicolor_mantel
```

The mantel() correlation test yields a p-value ~ 0.4 (rougly similar to the p-value from the permutations test) and a Mantel statistic of r = 0.0106

```{r}
#construct boxplot comparison of permutation test to mantel test
boxplot(list(null_versicolor_cor, versicolor_mantel$perm), horizontal = T, boxwex = 0.5,
        names = c('Permutation', 'Mantel'), xlab='Correlation', main = 'Tachigali versicolor correlation')
abline(v=obs_versicolor_cor, col='red')
```

Both indicate that observed correlation is not significantly greater than null correlation. As a result, the distribution of Tachigali versicolor is not spatially dependent but instead appears to be random. There does not appear to be evidence of spatial dependence for the distribution of this species.

2) Build two generalized linear models to predict the abundance of the species Drypetes standleyi using the abundance of other tree species in the study site. Specifically examine the following species as predictor variables:

```{r}
sp_ids = c("Cordia.lasiocalyx", "Hirtella.triandra",
           "Picramnia.latifolia", "Quassia.amara",
           "Tabernaemontana.arborea", "Trattinnickia.aspera", 
           "Xylopia.macrantha")
```

Note renaming the species ids to something a little easier to work with like “sp_a”, “sp_b” will make model construction a little less cumbersome
Model 1: only include a single species as a predictor variable
Model 2: include all of the species as predictor variables

With both models examine the spatial dependence of the residuals using the function Variogram(). Model the spatial dependence in the residuals using one of the error structures available.
Did including the spatial error term have a large impact on the coefficients of the model?
Did including the spatial error terms significantly improve model fit (use function anova to carry out model comparison)?
Explain why you did or did not observe a difference in the influence of adding the spatial error term between the two models.


#Model 1- Drypetes.standleyi abundance with one species as a predictor variable - Cordia lasiocalyx

```{r}
#Do a preliminary examination of the data and test for spatial dependence in either of these species
#create a data subset for each
standleyi = BCI[ , "Drypetes.standleyi"]
lasiocalyx = BCI[ , "Cordia.lasiocalyx"]

#calculate Euclidian distances
standleyi_dist = dist(standleyi)
lasiocalyx_dist = dist(lasiocalyx)

#calculate spatial distance
xy_dist = dist(BCI_xy)

#create parameter for max distance
max_dist = max(xy_dist) / 2

#plot results
plot(xy_dist, standleyi_dist, xlab = "Spatial Distance", ylab = "Euclidian Distance", main = "Drypetes standleyi spatial dependence")
abline(lm(standleyi_dist ~ xy_dist), lwd=3, col='red')
lines(lowess(xy_dist, standleyi_dist), lwd=3, col='pink')
abline(v = max_dist, col='red', lwd=3, lty=2)
plot(xy_dist, lasiocalyx_dist, xlab = "Spatial Distance", ylab = "Euclidian Distance", main = "Cordia lasiocalyx spatial dependence")
abline(lm(lasiocalyx_dist ~ xy_dist), lwd=3, col='red')
lines(lowess(xy_dist, lasiocalyx_dist), lwd=3, col='pink')
abline(v = max_dist, col='red', lwd=3, lty=2)
```

Both the theoretical and smoother lines have positive slopes, providing evidence that both standleyi and lasiocalyx abundances are spatially dependent.

```{r}
#create a single-variable linear model to explain standleyi abundance in terms of Cordia lasiocalyx abundance 
standleyi_1var_lm = gls(Drypetes.standleyi ~ Cordia.lasiocalyx, data = BCI)
x = BCI_xy$x
y = BCI_xy$y

#use Variogram() to examine spatial dependence of residuals
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_1var_lm, form= ~ x + y), main = "standleyi 1 var fit")
res = residuals(standleyi_1var_lm)
plot(dist(BCI_xy[, c('x', 'y')]), dist(res), main = "standleyi 1 var spatial dependence of residuals")
lines(lowess(dist(BCI_xy[, c('x', 'y')]), dist(res)), col='red', lwd=2)
abline(v = max_dist, col='red', lwd=3, lty=2)
```

There is a slight positive slope

Model updates for inclusion of an exponential spatial error term:

```{r}
#update model to include exponential error structure to account for spatial dependence
standleyi_1var_exp = update(standleyi_1var_lm, corr=corExp(form=~x + y))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_1var_exp, maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi 1 var exp fit")

#update plot to examine normalized residuals
plot(Variogram(standleyi_1var_exp, resType='normalized', maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi 1 var exp normalized fit")

#update model to include nugget 
standleyi_1var_exp_nug = update(standleyi_1var_exp, corr=corExp(form=~x + y, nugget=T))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_1var_exp_nug, maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi 1 var exp nugget fit")

#update plot to examine normalized residuals with nugget
plot(Variogram(standleyi_1var_exp_nug, resType='n', maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi 1 var exp nugget normalized fit")
```

Model updates for inclusion of a rational quadratic spatial error term:

```{r}
#update model to include rational quadratic error structure to account for spatial dependence
standleyi_1var_rat = update(standleyi_1var_lm, corr=corRatio(form=~x + y, nugget=F))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_1var_rat, maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi 1 var rational quad fit")

#update plot with normalized distribution
plot(Variogram(standleyi_1var_rat, resType='n', maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi 1 var rational quad normalized fit")

#update model to include nugget
standleyi_1var_rat_nug = update(standleyi_1var_lm, corr=corRatio(form=~x + y, nugget=T))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_1var_rat_nug, maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi 1 var rational quad nugget fit")

#update plot with normalized distribution
plot(Variogram(standleyi_1var_rat_nug, resType='n', maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi 1 var rational quad nugget normalized fit")
```

Of the above models, the plots that appear to best fit the data are the normalized exponential, normalized exponential nugget, normalized rational quadratic, and normalized rational quadratic nugget. 

```{r}
#examine the result of inclusion of the error term on the model coefficients
coef(standleyi_1var_lm)
coef(standleyi_1var_exp)
coef(standleyi_1var_exp_nug)
coef(standleyi_1var_rat)
coef(standleyi_1var_rat_nug)
```

The inclusion of both the exponential and rational quadtratic error terms had a large impact on the model coefficients when compared to the coefficients of the model that does not include an error term. However, the coefficients for the model with the exponential error term and the model with the rational quadratic error term + nugget appear to be relatively similar. 

```{r}
#examine the effect of inclusion of the error terms on overall model fit
anova(standleyi_1var_lm, standleyi_1var_exp, standleyi_1var_exp_nug, standleyi_1var_rat, standleyi_1var_rat_nug, test=F)

#examine whether inclusion of this term significantly improved model performance
anova(standleyi_1var_lm, standleyi_1var_rat_nug, test=T)
```

Based on the AIC values, the standleyi_1var_rat_nug model containing a rational quadratic error term with a nugget provides the best fit. Inclusion of this error term appears to have significantly improved the overall fit of the model relative to the original model (p<.0001).





#Model 2 - Drypetes.standleyi abundance with all interest species included as predictor variables

```{r}
#list of interst species
sp_ids = c("Cordia.lasiocalyx", "Hirtella.triandra",
           "Picramnia.latifolia", "Quassia.amara",
           "Tabernaemontana.arborea", "Trattinnickia.aspera", 
           "Xylopia.macrantha")

#create a multi-variable linear model to explain standleyi abundance in terms of the abundances of all species of interest 
standleyi_multvar_lm = gls(Drypetes.standleyi ~ Cordia.lasiocalyx + Hirtella.triandra + Picramnia.latifolia + Quassia.amara + Tabernaemontana.arborea + Trattinnickia.aspera + Xylopia.macrantha, data = BCI)

#use Variogram() to examine spatial dependence of residuals
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_multvar_lm), main = "standleyi Multvar Mod fit")
res2 = residuals(standleyi_multvar_lm)
plot(dist(BCI_xy[, c('x', 'y')]), dist(res2), main = "standleyi multvar spatial dependence of residuals")
lines(lowess(dist(BCI_xy[, c('x', 'y')]), dist(res2)), col='red', lwd=2)
abline(v = max_dist, col='red', lwd=3, lty=2)
```

The line here is relatively flat, indicating that there may not be evidence of spatial dependence. 

Model updates for inclusion of an exponential spatial error term:

```{r}
#update model to include exponential error structure to account for spatial dependence
standleyi_multvar_exp = update(standleyi_multvar_lm, corr=corExp(form=~x + y))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_multvar_exp, maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi multvar exp fit")

#update plot to examine normalized residuals
plot(Variogram(standleyi_multvar_exp, resType='normalized', maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi multvar exp normalized fit")

#update model to include nugget 
standleyi_multvar_exp_nug = update(standleyi_multvar_exp, corr=corExp(form=~x + y, nugget=T))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_multvar_exp_nug, maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi multvar exp nugget fit")

#update plot with normalized residuals
plot(Variogram(standleyi_multvar_exp_nug, resType='n', maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi multvar exp nugget normalized fit")
```

Model updates for inclusion of a rational quadratic spatial error term:

```{r}
#update model to include rational quadratic error structure to account for spatial dependence
standleyi_multvar_rat = update(standleyi_multvar_lm, corr=corRatio(form=~x + y, nugget=F))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_multvar_rat, maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi multvar rational quad fit")

#update plot with normalized distribution
plot(Variogram(standleyi_multvar_rat, resType='n', maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi multvar rational quad normalized fit")

#update model to include nugget
standleyi_multvar_rat_nug = update(standleyi_multvar_lm, corr=corRatio(form=~x + y, nugget=T))
plot(Variogram(standleyi_multvar_rat_nug, maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi multivar rational quad nugget fit")

#update plot with normalized distribution
plot(Variogram(standleyi_multvar_rat_nug, resType='n', maxDist = max_dist), main = "standleyi multivar rational quad nugget normalized fit")
```

Of the above models, the plots that appear to best fit the data are the normalized exponential nugget and the normalized rational quadratic nugget.

```{r}
#examine the result of inclusion of the error term on the model coefficients
coef(standleyi_multvar_lm)
coef(standleyi_multvar_exp)
coef(standleyi_multvar_exp_nug)
coef(standleyi_multvar_rat)
coef(standleyi_multvar_rat_nug)
```

The inclusion of the exponential error term and the rational quadratic error term had the largest effect on the model coefficient for Quassia amara (went from ~4 in the original model to ~1-2 in the other models) and on the intercept. However, overall the coefficients did not appear to be changed by more than 3 at the most by the inclusion of the error terms. 

```{r}
#examine the effect of inclusion of the error terms on overall model fit
anova(standleyi_multvar_lm, standleyi_multvar_exp, standleyi_multvar_exp_nug, standleyi_multvar_rat, standleyi_multvar_rat_nug, test=F)

#examine whether inclusion of this term significantly improved model performance
anova(standleyi_multvar_lm, standleyi_multvar_exp, standleyi_multvar_exp_nug, test=T)
```

Based on the AIC values, the standleyi_multvar_exp model and the standleyi_multvar_exp_nug model provide the best fit for the data. Of these two models, the inclusion of the exponential error term in the standleyi_multvar_exp model significantly improved the fit of the model relative to the original model (p=0.0061), whereas the standleyi_multvar_exp_nug model did not (p=0.1994).


Effect of adding spatial terms between the two models:

For the standleyi 1 variable model, the addition of the rational quadratic error term to the model significantly improved the model's overall fit of the data. For the standleyi multivariable model, the addition of the exponential error term to the model significantly improved the fit. Both models displayed a statistically significant difference relative to the original models when an error term was added. This was possibly the result of Drypetes standleyi abundance being spatially dependent on the abundances of each species included in the single variable and multivariable models, so the addition of an error term to each model in order to account for spatial distribution error would have increased the ability of each model to fit their respective data.
