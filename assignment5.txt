1) Examine if there is evidence of spatial dependence in a rare and a common species in the BCI tree dataset.

```{r}
sp_total = apply(BCI, 2, sum)
sp_total
mean(sp_total)
hist(colSums(BCI))
hist(log10(colSums(BCI)))
```

A common species can be defines as having an abundance greater than 1000
A rare species can be defined as having an abundance less than 100

Common Species :: "Trichilia.tuberculata" - 1681
Rare Species :: "Tachigali.versicolor" - 98


*Trichilia tuberculata* - Common Species

```{r}
#create a data subset for tuberculata
tuberculata = BCI[ , "Trichilia.tuberculata"]

#calculate tuberculata Euclidian distance
tuberculata_dist = dist(tuberculata)

#calculate spatial distance
xy_dist = dist(BCI_xy)

#create parameter for max distance
max_dist = max(xy_dist) / 2

#plot tuberculata results
plot(xy_dist, tuberculata_dist, main = "Trichilia tuberculata")
abline(lm(tuberculata_dist ~ xy_dist), lwd=3, col='red')
lines(lowess(xy_dist, tuberculata_dist), lwd=3, col='pink')
abline(v = max_dist, col='red', lwd=3, lty=2)
```

In the above graphic, both the theoretical and smoother line are relatively flat, indicating that the distribution of Trichilia tuberculata is not spatially structured but is instead random. 

```{r}
#compute observed correlation of tuberculata Euclidian distance to overall spatial distance
obs_tuberculata_cor = cor(xy_dist, tuberculata_dist)
obs_tuberculata_cor
```

Observed correlation = 0.02876206 (~2.9% correlation)

```{r}
#permutation test for tuberculata significance
nperm = 1000
null_tuberculata_cor = obs_tuberculata_cor
for (i in 2:nperm) {
  tuber_tmp_xy = BCI_xy[sample(nrow(BCI_xy)), ]
  null_tuberculata_cor[i] = cor(dist(tuber_tmp_xy), tuberculata_dist)
}
sum(null_tuberculata_cor >= obs_tuberculata_cor) / nperm 
```

p-value ~ 0.3, variance between tuberculata Euclidian distance and overall spatial distance is insignificant (observed correlation is not significantly different from null correlation)

```{r}
#mantel() function test for tuberculata
tuberculata_mantel = mantel(xy_dist, tuberculata_dist)
tuberculata_mantel
```

The mantel() correlation test yields a p-value ~ 0.3 (rougly similar to the p-value from the permutations test) and a Mantel statistic of r = 0.02876

```{r}
#boxplot comparison of permutation test to mantel test
boxplot(list(null_tuberculata_cor, tuberculata_mantel$perm), horizontal = T, boxwex = 0.5,
        names = c('Permutation', 'Mantel'), xlab='Correlation', main = 'Trichilia tuberculata correlation')
abline(v=obs_tuberculata_cor, col='red')
```

The results of both tests look relatively similar. Both indicate that observed correlation is not significantly greater than null correlation. Instead, there appears to be no statistically significant difference between observed correlation and null correlation, indicating that the distribution of Trichilia tuberculata is not significantly correlated to spatial structure but rather appears to be random. 



*Tachigali versicolor* - Rare species


```{r}
#create data subset for Tachigali versicolor
versicolor = BCI[ , "Tachigali.versicolor"]

#calculate Euclidian distance
versicolor_dist = dist(versicolor)

#calculate spatial distance
xy_dist = dist(BCI_xy)

#create parameter for max distance
max_dist = max(xy_dist) / 2

#plot versicolor results
plot(xy_dist, versicolor_dist, main = "Tachigali versicolor")
abline(lm(versicolor_dist ~ xy_dist), lwd=3, col='red')
lines(lowess(xy_dist, versicolor_dist), lwd=3, col='pink')
abline(v = max_dist, col='red', lwd=3, lty=2)
```

The above graph gives similar results as Trichilia tuberculata. Both the theoretical and smoother lines are relatively flat, indicating that versicolor distribution is not spatially dependent but appears to be random.  

```{r}
#compute observed correlation of versicolor Euclidian distance to overall spatial distance
obs_versicolor_cor = cor(xy_dist, versicolor_dist)
obs_versicolor_cor
```

Observed correlation = 0.01059894 (~1.1% correlation)

```{r}
#permutation test for versicolor significance
nperm = 1000
null_versicolor_cor = obs_versicolor_cor
for (i in 2:nperm) {
  versi_tmp_xy = BCI_xy[sample(nrow(BCI_xy)), ]
  null_versicolor_cor[i] = cor(dist(versi_tmp_xy), versicolor_dist)
}
sum(null_versicolor_cor >= obs_versicolor_cor) / nperm
```

p-value ~ 0.4, variance between versicolor Euclidian distance and overall spatial distance is insignificant (observed correlation is not larger than null)

```{r}
#mantel() function test for versicolor
versicolor_mantel = mantel(xy_dist, versicolor_dist)
versicolor_mantel
```

The mantel() correlation test yields a p-value ~ 0.4 (rougly similar to the p-value from the permutations test) and a Mantel statistic of r = 0.0106

```{r}
#boxplot comparison of permutation test to mantel test
boxplot(list(null_versicolor_cor, versicolor_mantel$perm), horizontal = T, boxwex = 0.5,
        names = c('Permutation', 'Mantel'), xlab='Correlation', main = 'Tachigali versicolor correlation')
abline(v=obs_versicolor_cor, col='red')
```

The results of both tests look relatively similar. Both indicate that observed correlation is not significantly greater than null correlation. As a result, the distribution of Tachigali versicolor is not spatially dependant but instead appears to be random.

2) Build two generalized linear models to predict the abundance of the species Drypetes standleyi using the abundance of other tree species in the study site. Specifically examine the following species as predictor variables:

```{r}
sp_ids = c("Cordia.lasiocalyx", "Hirtella.triandra",
           "Picramnia.latifolia", "Quassia.amara",
           "Tabernaemontana.arborea", "Trattinnickia.aspera", 
           "Xylopia.macrantha")




```

Note renaming the species ids to something a little easier to work with like “sp_a”, “sp_b” will make model construction a little less cumbersome
Model 1: only include a single species as a predictor variable
Model 2: include all of the species as predictor variables


With both models examine the spatial dependence of the residuals using the function Variogram. Model the spatial dependence in the residuals using one of the error structures available.
Did including the spatial error term have a large impact on the coefficients of the model?
Did including the spatial error terms significantly improve model fit (use function anova to carry out model comparison)?
Explain why you did or did not observe a difference in the influence of adding the spatial error term between the two models.




























Red line = theoretical
Pink line = smoother
Flat - abundance is not spatially structured but is instead random 

If it were positive - aggregation (i.e. spatial dependence)
If it were negative - non aggregation
