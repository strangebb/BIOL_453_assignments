1.) Develop and compare models for species cover for Acer rubrum and Abies fraseri. Compare p-values you observe using the function anova() to those using summary(). For each species address the following additional questions:
-How well does the exploratory model appear to explain cover?
-Which explanatory variables are the most important?
-Do model diagnostics indicate any problems with violations of OLS assumptions?
-Are you able to explain variance in one species better than another, why might this be the case? 


Initial graphical analysis of the data yields several observations and visible trends. First, the graph depicting the relationship between plot elevation and species abundance reveals that the plots up until rougly 1500 meters elevation are mostly inhabited by Acer rubrum, while the plots above 1500 meters elevation are mostly inhabited by Abies fraseri. Second, the boxblots depicting the relationship between the categorical variable "disturbance" and the level of species abundance in each plot reveals that while Acer rubrum has an abundance of roughly ~50% in each disturbance treatment, Abies fraseri shows a much more varied distribution of abundance with the highest occurring in the "VIRGIN" disturbance treatment.



*SINGLE VARIABLE MODELS*

ELEVATION MODELS


```{r}
#Acer rubrum elevation model
rubrum_elev_mod = lm(cover ~ elev, data = rubrum)
#Abies fraseri elevation model
fraseri_elev_mod = lm(cover ~ elev, data = fraseri)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(cover ~ elev, data = rubrum, xlab = 'Plot Elevation (m)',ylab = 'Abundance', main = 'Acer rubrum')
abline(rubrum_elev_mod)

plot(cover ~ elev, data = fraseri, 
     xlab = 'Plot Elevation (m)', ylab = 'Abundance', main = 'Abies fraseri')
abline(fraseri_elev_mod)
```

Above graph indicates potential corrlation between elevation and abundance of Abies fraseri, but not clear correlation for Acer rubrum.

```{r}
plot(cover ~ elev, data = trees, type = 'n', 
     xlab = 'Plot Elevation (m)', ylab = 'Abundance', main = 'Elevation vs. Abundance')
points(cover ~ elev, data = trees, subset = species == "Acer rubrum",
       pch = 1, col = 'red')
lines(lowess(trees$elev[trees$species == 'Acer rubrum'],
             trees$cover[trees$species == 'Acer rubrum']),
      lty = 1, col = 'red')
points(cover ~ elev, data = trees, subset = species == "Abies fraseri",
       pch = 2, col = 'blue')
lines(lowess(trees$elev[trees$species == 'Abies fraseri'],
             trees$cover[trees$species == 'Abies fraseri']),
      lty = 2, col = 'blue')
legend('topleft', c('Acer rubrum', 'Abies fraseri'), col = c('red', 'blue'), 
       pch = c(1, 2), lty = c(1, 2), bty = 'n')

ggplot(data = rubrum, mapping = aes(x = elev, y = cover)) + 
  labs(title = 'Acer rubrum Plot Elevation (m) vs. Abundance', x = 'Plot Elevation (m)', y = "Abundance") + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = species, color = species), method = 'loess') +
    scale_color_manual(values = "red") +
    theme_classic() 
ggplot(data = fraseri, mapping = aes(x = elev, y = cover)) + 
  labs(title = 'Abies fraseri Plot Elevation (m) vs. Abundance', x = 'Plot Elevation (m)', y = "Abundance") + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = species, color = species), method = 'loess') +
    scale_color_manual(values = "blue") +
    theme_classic()

```

```{r}
#Statistics for rubrum elevation model
summary(rubrum_elev_mod)
anova(rubrum_elev_mod)
```

Both tests gives similar p-values with statistical significance but only ~1% variance explained  

```{r}
#Statistics for fraseri elevation model
summary(fraseri_elev_mod)
anova(fraseri_elev_mod)
```

Both tests give similar p-values with statistical significance and with ~48% variance explained. 

Thus, the fraseri_elev model is able to better explain fraseri abundance while the rubrum_elev model is not able to explain rubrum abundance to the same extent. The variable of elevation is a better predictor of Abies fraseri abundance.  


STREAMDIST MODELS


```{r}
#Acer rubrum stream distance model
rubrum_streamdist_mod = lm(cover ~ streamdist, data = rubrum)
#Abies fraseri stream distance model
fraseri_streamdist_mod = lm(cover ~ streamdist, data = fraseri)
plot(cover ~ streamdist, data = trees, type = 'n', 
     xlab = 'Distance to Nearest Stream (m)', ylab = 'Abundance', main = 'Stream Distance vs. Abundance')
points(cover ~ streamdist, data = trees, subset = species == "Acer rubrum",
       pch = 1, col = 'red')
abline(rubrum_streamdist_mod)
points(cover ~ streamdist, data = trees, subset = species == "Abies fraseri",
       pch = 2, col = 'blue')
abline(fraseri_streamdist_mod)
legend('topleft', c('Acer rubrum', 'Abies fraseri'), col = c('red', 'blue'), 
       pch = c(1, 2), bty = 'n')

```


```{r}
plot(cover ~ streamdist, data = trees, type = 'n', 
     xlab = 'Nearest Stream Distance (m)', ylab = 'Abundance')
points(cover ~ streamdist, data = trees, subset = species == "Acer rubrum",
       pch = 1, col = 'red')
lines(lowess(trees$streamdist[trees$species == 'Acer rubrum'],
             trees$cover[trees$species == 'Acer rubrum']),
      lty = 1, col = 'red')
points(cover ~ streamdist, data = trees, subset = species == "Abies fraseri",
       pch = 2, col = 'blue')
lines(lowess(trees$streamdist[trees$species == 'Abies fraseri'],
             trees$cover[trees$species == 'Abies fraseri']),
      lty = 2, col = 'blue')
legend('topleft', c('Acer rubrum', 'Abies fraseri'), col = c('red', 'blue'), 
       pch = c(1, 2), lty = c(1, 2), bty = 'n')

ggplot(data = rubrum, mapping = aes(x = streamdist, y = cover)) + 
  labs(title = 'Acer rubrum Stream Distance (m) vs. Abundance', x = 'Nearest Stream Distance (m)', y = "Abundance") + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = species, color = species), method = 'loess') +
    scale_color_manual(values = "red") +
    theme_classic() 
ggplot(data = fraseri, mapping = aes(x = streamdist, y = cover)) + 
  labs(title = 'Abies fraseri Stream Distance (m) vs. Abundance', x = 'Nearest Stream Distance (m)', y = "Abundance") + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = species, color = species), method = 'loess') +
    scale_color_manual(values = "blue") +
    theme_classic()

```


```{r}
#Statistics for rubrum stream distance model 
summary(rubrum_streamdist_mod)
anova(rubrum_streamdist_mod)
```

```{r}
#Statistics for fraseri stream distance model
summary(fraseri_streamdist_mod)
anova(fraseri_streamdist_mod)
```


For the rubrum_streamdist model, the summary and Anova functions indicate a p-value of ~0.01 but with only ~0.8% variance explained. Similarly, the fraseri_streamdist model gives a p-value of 0.04 with only ~9% variance explained. Therefore, the models accounting for the streamdist variable alone do not sufficiently explain variance of abundance for either species.



HEAT LOAD INDEX MODELS

```{r}
#Acer rubrum heat load index model
rubrum_beers_mod = lm(cover ~ beers, data = rubrum)
#Abies fraseri heat load index model
fraseri_beers_mod = lm(cover ~ beers, data = fraseri)
plot(cover ~ beers, data = trees, type = 'n', 
     xlab = 'Heat Load Index', ylab = 'Abundance', main = 'Heat Load Index vs. Abundance')
points(cover ~ beers, data = trees, subset = species == "Acer rubrum",
       pch = 1, col = 'red')
abline(rubrum_beers_mod)
points(cover ~ beers, data = trees, subset = species == "Abies fraseri",
       pch = 2, col = 'blue')
abline(fraseri_beers_mod)
legend('topleft', c('Acer rubrum', 'Abies fraseri'), col = c('red', 'blue'), 
       pch = c(1, 2), bty = 'n')
```

```{r}
plot(cover ~ beers, data = trees, type = 'n', 
     xlab = 'Heat Load Index', ylab = 'Abundance')
points(cover ~ beers, data = trees, subset = species == "Acer rubrum",
       pch = 1, col = 'red')
lines(lowess(trees$beers[trees$species == 'Acer rubrum'],
             trees$cover[trees$species == 'Acer rubrum']),
      lty = 1, col = 'red')
points(cover ~ beers, data = trees, subset = species == "Abies fraseri",
       pch = 2, col = 'blue')
lines(lowess(trees$beers[trees$species == 'Abies fraseri'],
             trees$cover[trees$species == 'Abies fraseri']),
      lty = 2, col = 'blue')
legend('topleft', c('Acer rubrum', 'Abies fraseri'), col = c('red', 'blue'), 
       pch = c(1, 2), lty = c(1, 2), bty = 'n')

ggplot(data = rubrum, mapping = aes(x = beers, y = cover)) + 
  labs(title = 'Acer rubrum Heat Load Index vs. Abundance', x = 'Heat Load Index', y = "Abundance") + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = species, color = species), method = 'loess') +
    scale_color_manual(values = "red") +
    theme_classic() 
ggplot(data = fraseri, mapping = aes(x = beers, y = cover)) + 
  labs(title = 'Abies fraseri Heat Load Index vs. Abundance', x = 'Heat Load Index', y = "Abundance") + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = species, color = species), method = 'loess') +
    scale_color_manual(values = "blue") +
    theme_classic()

```

```{r}
#Statistics for rubrum beers model
summary(rubrum_beers_mod)
anova(rubrum_beers_mod)
#Statistics for fraseri beers model
summary(fraseri_beers_mod)
anova(fraseri_beers_mod)
```

For the rubrum_beers model, a p-value of ~0.001 is given with only ~1.4% analysis explained. For the fraseri_beers model, a p-value of ~0.23 is given with only ~3% of variance explained. Thus, this model does not sufficiently account for coverage variance in either species. 



SITE WATER POTENTIAL MODELS

```{r}
#Acer rubrum water potential model
rubrum_tci_mod = lm(cover ~ tci, data = rubrum)
#Abies fraseri water potential model
fraseri_tci_mod = lm(cover ~ tci, data = fraseri)
plot(cover ~ tci, data = trees, type = 'n', 
     xlab = 'Site Water Potential', ylab = 'Abundance', main = 'Site Water Potential vs. Abundance')
points(cover ~ tci, data = trees, subset = species == "Acer rubrum",
       pch = 1, col = 'red')
abline(rubrum_tci_mod)
points(cover ~ tci, data = trees, subset = species == "Abies fraseri",
       pch = 2, col = 'blue')
abline(fraseri_tci_mod)
legend('topleft', c('Acer rubrum', 'Abies fraseri'), col = c('red', 'blue'), 
       pch = c(1, 2), bty = 'n')
ggplot(data = rubrum, mapping = aes(x = tci, y = cover)) + 
  labs(title = 'Acer rubrum Water Potential vs. Abundance', x = 'Water Potential', y = "Abundance") + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = species, color = species), method = 'loess') +
    scale_color_manual(values = "red") +
    theme_classic() 
ggplot(data = fraseri, mapping = aes(x = tci, y = cover)) + 
  labs(title = 'Abies fraseri Water Potential vs. Abundance', x = 'Water Potential', y = "Abundance") + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
    geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = species, color = species), method = 'loess') +
    scale_color_manual(values = "blue") +
    theme_classic()
```

```{r}
#Stats for rubrum tci model
summary(rubrum_tci_mod)
anova(rubrum_tci_mod)
#Stats for fraseri tci mod
summary(fraseri_tci_mod)
anova(fraseri_tci_mod)
```


For the rubrum_tci model, a p-value of ~0.08 is given with ~0.4% variance explained. For the fraseri_tci model, a p-value of ~0.67 is given with ~0.4% variance explained, meaning neither model sufficiently explaines the coverage variance for their respective species. 


DISTURBANCE MODELS

```{r}
rubrum_disturb_mod = lm(cover ~ disturb, data = rubrum)
fraseri_disturb_mod = lm(cover ~ disturb, data = fraseri)
#Stats for rubrum disturbance model
summary(rubrum_disturb_mod)
anova(rubrum_disturb_mod)
#Stats for rubrum disturbance model
summary(fraseri_disturb_mod)
anova(fraseri_disturb_mod)
```

Statistical analysis of the Acer rubrum disturbance model does not indicate statistical significance for any of the disturbance treatments. However, the disturbance treatment of "VIRGIN" yields statistical significance for Abies fraseri abundance, with ~21% variance explained. 




COMBINED MODELS WITH ALL VARIABLES

*ACER RUBRUM*

```{r}
rubrum_main_mod = lm(cover ~ elev + beers + tci + streamdist + disturb, data = rubrum)
#Stats for rubrum_main_mod
summary(rubrum_main_mod)
anova(rubrum_main_mod)
```

With a combined Acer rubrum model, the anova test suggests that elev, beers, tci, and streamdist are statistically significant, but with only ~4% variance explained. 


```{r}
#Adjusting rubrum main model to remove least significant terms
rubrum_ebts_mod = lm(cover ~ elev + beers + tci + streamdist, data = rubrum)
summary(rubrum_ebts_mod)
anova(rubrum_ebts_mod)
```

This yields a statistically significant model but still with only ~4% variance explained. 

```{r}
#Adjusting rubrum ebts model to remove least significant term
rubrum_ebs_mod = update(rubrum_ebts_mod, . ~ . - tci)
summary(rubrum_ebs_mod)
anova(rubrum_ebs_mod)
```

This yields a statistically significant model but with only ~3.7% variance explained. Therefore, the rubrum_ebts model accounting for elev, beers, tci, and streamdist is the best of the combined models. 


*ABIES FRASERI*

```{r}
fraseri_main_mod = lm(cover ~ elev + beers + tci + streamdist + disturb, data = fraseri)
#Stats for fraseri_main_mod
summary(fraseri_main_mod)
anova(fraseri_main_mod)
```

This yields a statistically significant model with ~58% variance explained. The anova test indicates that the variables of elev and tci are the most significant. 

```{r}
#Adjusting fraseri_main_mod to remove least significant terms
fraseri_et_mod = lm(cover ~ elev + tci, data = fraseri)
summary(fraseri_et_mod)
anova(fraseri_et_mod)
```

This yields a statistically significant model with ~52% variance explained. 





COMBINED MODELS ACCOUNTING FOR VARIABLE INTERACTION


*ACER RUBRUM*

```{r}
#Analysis of potential interactions within Acer rubrum data
panel.cor <- function(x, y, digits = 2, prefix = "", cex.cor=3, ...)
{
    usr <- par("usr"); on.exit(par(usr))
    par(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
    r <- abs(cor(x, y))
    txt <- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits = digits)[1]
    txt <- paste0(prefix, txt)
    if(missing(cex.cor)) 
        cex.cor <- 0.8/strwidth(txt)
    text(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor)
}
par(mfrow=c(6, 6))
pairs(cover ~ elev + tci + streamdist + disturb + beers, subset = species == "Acer rubrum", data = trees)
pairs(cover ~ elev + tci + streamdist + disturb + beers, subset = species == "Acer rubrum", data = trees, lower.panel = panel.smooth, upper.panel = panel.cor)
```

Analysis of potential variable interactions within the Acer rubrum dataset does not reveal any close correlations between cover and any of the explanatory variables. In addition, it does not appear to indicate any close correlations between any of the explanatory variables.  



*ABIES FRASERI*


```{r}
#Analysis of potential interactions within Abies fraseri data
par(mfrow=c(6, 6))
pairs(cover ~ elev + tci + streamdist + disturb + beers, subset = species == "Abies fraseri", data = trees)
pairs(cover ~ elev + tci + streamdist + disturb + beers, subset = species == "Abies fraseri", data = trees, lower.panel = panel.smooth, upper.panel = panel.cor)
```

This pairs chart for Abies fraseri indicates that cover is possibly correlated to the elev, streamdist, and disturb explanatory variables (strongest correlation between cover and elev). In addition, there appears to be potential correlation between the variables of elev & disturbance and elev & streamdist. 

```{r}
#A graphical representation of these potential correlations
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(cover ~ elev, data = fraseri, xlab = "Elevation (m)", ylab = "Cover")
plot(cover ~ streamdist, data = fraseri, xlab = "Nearest Stream Distance (m)", ylab = "Cover")
plot(streamdist ~ elev, data = fraseri, xlab = "Elevation (m)", ylab = "Nearest Stream Distance (m)")
boxplot(elev ~ disturb, data = fraseri, xlab = "Disturbance", ylab = "Elevation (m)")
```

Clear correlation between elevation and cover, as well as elevation and streamdist. Streams are likely more sparse at higher elevations. However, there doesn't appear to be a clear correlation between streamdist and cover.  With disturbance, the plots classified as "Virgin" tend to occur more frequently at higher elevations, possibly due to increased difficulty of logging at higher elevations. 


```{r}
#Adjusting the Abies fraseri model to account for potential variable interactions. Using the aov() function since "disturb" is not classified as a continuous variable 
fraseri_int_mod = aov(cover ~ elev + disturb + disturb:elev, data = fraseri)
summary(fraseri_interaction_mod)
anova(fraseri_interaction_mod)
```

This yields a statistically significant model with ~57.5% variance explaiend. 





MODEL DIAGNOSTICS


*ACER RUBRUM*

```{r}
#AIC Values for the rubrum models
AIC(rubrum_elev_mod)
AIC(rubrum_beers_mod)
AIC(rubrum_streamdist_mod)
AIC(rubrum_tci_mod)
AIC(rubrum_disturb_mod)
AIC(rubrum_main_mod)
AIC(rubrum_ebts_mod)
```


Of the models listed above, the rubrum_ebts model accounting for elevation, beers, tci, and streamdist yields the lowest AIC value, further suggesting that the explanatory variables of elev, beers, tci, and streamdist best account for the variance of cover.  


```{r}
#Diagnostics for rubrum main model
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(rubrum_ebts_mod)
```


For the Acer rubrum model, the diagnostics suggest that the assumption of homoscedasticity does not hold and outliers are present. However, the assumption of normal distribution is preserved. 


*ABIES FRASERI*

```{r}
#AIC Values for the fraseri models
AIC(fraseri_elev_mod)
AIC(fraseri_beers_mod)
AIC(fraseri_streamdist_mod)
AIC(fraseri_tci_mod)
AIC(fraseri_disturb_mod)
AIC(fraseri_main_mod)
AIC(fraseri_et_mod)
AIC(fraseri_int_mod)
```

Here, the fraseri_et model accounting for elevation and tci yields the smallest AIC value.   


```{r}
#Model diagnostics for the fraseri_int model
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(fraseri_int_mod)
```

Model diagnostics of the fraseri_int model reveal that the assumptions of homoscadisticity holds, but the model appears to deviate from normal distribution. 

```{r}
#Model diagnostics for the frasseri_et model
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(fraseri_et_mod)
```

The above model diagnostics for the fraseri_et model suggest that the assumptions of homoscedasticity and normal distribution are preserved, but there does appear to be an outlier present. Nevertheless, the fraseri_et model accounting for elevation and tci is likely the best fit model, based on it having the lowest AIC value and the preservation of OLS assumptions (except for outliers).



*Acer rubrum* For A. rubrum, none of the variables alone appear to sufficiently explain variation of abundance. In general, abundance is poorly explained, based on most models indicating that only roughly 4% of variance is accounted for. 
*Abies fraseri* For A. fraseri, elevation and tci appear to be the most important in terms of explaining variation of abundance. 

Overall, variance is better explained for Abies fraseri than for Acer rubrum. Although the Acer rubrum model for all variables and the ebts model for only elev, beers, tci, and streamdist are able to achieve statistical significance for contained variables, their relatively small % of variance explained means that they are not able to adequately account for variance of the abundance coverage variable. However, the achieved statistical significance and ~57% variance explained for the Abies fraseri elevation/tci model means that it is better able to account for variance of the A. fraseri abundance coverage variable. Since Acer rubrum is a habitat generalist, it would make sense that the presented variables are not able to sufficiently explain the distribution of A. rubrum abundance since the species is able to thrive in a wide range of habitat conditions. Furthermore, since Abies fraseri is a habitat specialist, it would make sense that the variables are able to better explain the variance of A. fraseri abundance distribution since the species is only able to thrive in a narrow range of habitat conditions and plot altitudes. 




2.) Re-examine your solutions to the question above but from the perspective of a General Linear Model (GLM) with a Poisson error term (rather than a Gaussian one as in OLS). Compare your qualatitive assessment of which variables were most important in each model. Does it appear that changing the error distribution changed the results much? In what ways?


```{r}
rubrum_poi = glm(cover ~ tci + elev + beers + streamdist + disturb, data = rubrum, 
           family='poisson')
pseudo_r2 = function(glm_mod) {
                1 -  glm_mod$deviance / glm_mod$null.deviance
            }   
pseudo_r2(rubrum_poi)
summary(rubrum_ebts_mod)
```

For Acer rubrum, changing the error distribution to poisson does not appear to change the apparent variance explained (~4%).


```{r}
fraseri_poi = glm(cover ~ elev + tci, data = fraseri, 
           family='poisson')
pseudo_r2 = function(glm_mod) {
                1 -  glm_mod$deviance / glm_mod$null.deviance
            }   
pseudo_r2(fraseri_poi)
summary(fraseri_et_mod)
```


For Abies fraseri, changing the error distribution to poisson appears to lower the % variance explained (from ~52% to ~51%) when comparted to gaussian. 



3. Provide a plain English summary (i.e., no statistics) of what you have found and what conclusions we can take away from your analysis?

*Acer rubrum*
Analysis of the models for Acer rubrum abundance did not indicate that any of the variables of elevation, stream distance, site water potential, heat load index, or plot disturbance were able to sufficiently account for variance of species abundance by themselves. Since Acer rubrum is a habitat generalist, it is not limited by a narrow range of environmental factors but rather proliferates under a wide set of conditions. 

*Abies fraseri*
However, the analysis of the models for Abies fraseri abundance indicated that the variables of plot elevation and tci were able to best account for variance of A. fraseri abundance. As a result, the data appear to indicate that A. fraseri prefers higher elevation plots than Acer rubrum with certain tci water potential values. This is consistent with the observation that Abies fraseri is a habitat specialist, requiring a specific set of conditions in order to proliferate and compete with Acer rubrum. 



4. (Optional) Examine the behavior of the function stepAIC() using the exploratory models developed above. This is a very simple and not very robust machine learning stepwise algorithm that uses AIC to select a best model. By default it does a backward selection routine.

*Acer rubrum*
```{r}
stepAIC(rubrum_main_mod)
```

The above operation indicates that the rubrum model with the lowest AIC value would involve the variables elev, beers, tci, and streamdist, which is consistent with the rubrum_ebts model. 


```{r}
rubrum_ebts_mod = lm(cover ~ elev + beers + tci + streamdist, data = rubrum)
AIC(rubrum_ebts_mod)
#Stats for rubrum_ebts_mod
summary(rubrum_ebts_mod)
anova(rubrum_ebts_mod)
```

Analysis of this model reveals statistical significance but with only ~4% variance explained. 


*Abies fraseri*
```{r}
stepAIC(fraseri_main_mod)
```

The above operation indicates that the fraseri model with the lowest AIC value would involve the variables elev and tci, which is consistent with the fraseri_et model. 

```{r}
fraseri_et_mod = lm(cover ~ elev + tci, data = fraseri)
AIC(fraseri_et_mod)
#Stats for fraseri_et_mod
summary(fraseri_et_mod)
anova(fraseri_et_mod)
```

Analysis of this model reveals a lower AIC value compared to the other fraseri models. In addition, ~52% variance explained is achieved, but the elev variable is the only variable indicated to be statistically significant beyond 0.05.
